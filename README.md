# TheGamingRoom
### Module 8 Programming Portfolio
The client, "The Gaming Room," aims to develop a web-based game that can be accessed on multiple platforms. The company’s goal is to ensure the game runs on other operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. They want to base this new game on "Draw It or Lose It," which currently only operates on Android. 

## Requirments
  - Broader audience reach
  - Higher sales and increased user engagement

-  Video Editing Software
  - Must be high-quality
  - Available only for Macs 
  - Purpose: Create video clips for training and educational use
 
 Game Structure:
- Support for Multiple Teams:
  - Each team consists of several players
  - Names of games and teams must be unique
  - Only one game can exist in memory at any given time

Implementation:
- Incorporate unique identifiers and IDs for:
- Games
- Teams
- Players
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well in recommending the operating system archetecture. For example the storage management I know a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL should be used to manage structured data such as game sessions, teams, and player statistics. These databases work well on Windows and provide strong features like recording transactions, indexing data, and ensuring high availability through clustering or replication.
 
## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
This provided clarity and efficiency as a plan was in place. The document created a breakdown in tasks to make it manageable. I had the requirements, what to implement and contraints. The UML document made the data structure clear and how it will be created. This allowed me to see in one picture anything that is missing, is a potential issue, and to find the best platform. This is also very helpful when working in a team so everyone is on the same page with no overlap. 
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The design document was created to get the requirments, game structure, implementation, design contraints, and domain model. One step in interpreting the user needs was creating a UML for implementing into the software design. This allowed me to evaluate the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows) as well as mobile devices for the user needs.

It's importnat to consider the user needs, to achieve the goal, meet the intended purpose, and have enjoyable usage.  

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the design doc I compared development requirements for Mac, linux, windows, mobile devices. This compared the server and client side as well as their development tools. After finding their flixibility, cost, and supporting platforms I was able to make a recomendation based of the clients needs and goals. 
In the future I would use this same strategy based on the clients requirements to find the best solution to acheive the desired product. I think this gave a clear and consise why to analyze the options and present what is offered.
